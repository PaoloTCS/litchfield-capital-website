# Papers Directory

This directory contains PDF files of our published papers and research documents.

## Structure
- Each paper should be stored as a PDF file
- File names should match the entries in `/data/papers.json`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (e.g., `example-paper.pdf`)

## Adding New Papers
1. Add the PDF file to this directory
2. Update the papers.json file in the data directory
3. Ensure the PDF filename matches the entry in papers.json
